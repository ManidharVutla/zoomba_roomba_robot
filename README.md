## Overview

A small project of ROS with the use of Gazebo and turtle bot. Here we implemented algorithm of automatic vaccum cleaner which does floor cleaning automatically. If there is obstacle around it changes the path without colliding. Hence system moves in random ways and cleans whole floor without bot being damaged.

## Dependencies
### Install ROS
ROS should be installed on the system. This package is tested on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS with [ROS Kinetic Distribution](http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic).
Installation Instructions can be found [here](http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation).
- [Turtlebot](https://www.turtlebot.com/) packages are required. Run the following command to install all turtlebot related packages.
```
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-turtlebot*
```
- [Gazebo](http://wiki.ros.org/gazebo_ros_pkgs) version 7.0.0 or above. Installation instructions can be found [here](http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?cat=guided_b&tut=guided_b1).

### Install catkin
catkin is a Low-level build system macros and infrastructure for ROS.
catkin is included by default when ROS is installed. But, it can also be installed with apt-get

```
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-catkin
```

### Creating a catkin workspace
Create a catkin workspace using following instructions:
```
$ mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/harshkakashaniya/zoomba_roomba_robot
$ catkin_create_pkg zoomba_roomba_robot
```
### Build the program
```
cd ~/catkin_ws
catkin_make
```
catkin_make works as cmake and make of our Cmake process. After running this we will see two more folders named build and devel

### Run the program

## In Terminal
```
cd ~/catkin_ws
source devel/setup.bash
roslaunch zoomba_roomba_robot zoomba.launch Record:=true
```
by this command we will have Walker.bag file in result folder. One such sample file is kept in result/Walker.bag

## Disable bag file recording,
To Disable bag file recording, come to terminal
```
Press Ctrl+C
```
## Inspecting the bag file
to check what are the details of any particular bag file.

```
roscore
```
First command if roscore not already working else launch file should be working. 
```
cd ~catkin_ws/
rosbag info src/zoomba_roomba_robot/results/Walker.bag

```
We will see similar ouput

## Playing back the bag file following will be the output
```
roscore
```
First command if roscore not already working
```
cd catkin_ws/
source devel/setup.bash
rosbag play src/zoomba_roomba_robot/results/Walker.bag
```
Similar is the output of Rosbag when the above code is run.
